Hi,


I would like to introduce myself to you. 
My name is Hritik Pihal. I am a postgraduate from IIITM Gwalior. I am passionate about developing tech in an efficient way that can contribute to society in some or the other way.

I have worked as an intern with companies like Dell and start-ups like Arishti CyberTech and Adolfo where I had hands-on experience on frameworks like Golang, Node.js and Flutter. 


I have worked on NoSQL, SQL and GraphQL databases (MongoDB, MySQL and Neo4j) as well. I have developed microservices using API protocols like OpenAPI (HTTP), GRPC and Websockets. 
I have even used GCP, Kubernetes, Docker, Redis and Ingress to scale, deploy, containerize and fasten microservices through caching, load-balancing and efficient system design architectures.

I have even tried developing websites using Next.js, React.js, HTML and CSS. (Want to try them more.)
